    <p>"Experimental" 13 minute drony thing I made using some eurorack modules, with some effects and mastering done in Bespoke Synth. Received some mastering help from <a href="https://eschatonjxp.neocities.org">eschatonjxp</a>.</p> 
    <p>Modules used were those from the <a href="https://clacktronics.co.uk/byom/">Clacktronics Build-your-own-Modular</a> and Maths from Make Noise. Created early 2025.</p>
